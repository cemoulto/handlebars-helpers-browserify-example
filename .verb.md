## What is this?

This is a simple example showing how to use [browserify][] to bundle up an app using [handlebars-helpers][].

The `app` can be found in [app.js][./app.js] and is used in [index.html][./index.html].

To build the `app` run the following command:

```sh
$ gulp
```

This will browserify `app.js` and create a distribution file in [dist/app.js][./dist/app.js].

Load `index.html` in a browser and open up the console to see sample output.
