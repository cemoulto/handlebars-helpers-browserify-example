## What is this?

This is a simple example showing how to use [browserify][] to bundle up an app using [handlebars-helpers][].

The `app` can be found in [src/app.js][./src/app.js] and is used in [src/index.html][./src/index.html].

To build the `app` run the following command:

```sh
$ gulp
```

This will browserify `app.js` and create a distribution file in `_gh_pages/app.js`.

Load `_gh_pages/index.html` in a browser and open up the console to see sample output.

## Dev

Use the following command to run a [browser-sync][] server and have live-reloads. Making changes to `src` files will rebuild and reload the example.

```sh
$ gulp dev
```
